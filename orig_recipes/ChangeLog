	to do
	need to be able to pass in some tag so printout can show visually how deep in the tree we are. could be a space offset could be a depth number
	to do
	could also add the deep print as an override of print ?
	or could just add it into super directly so user can choose print or deep print ? maybe deep print should always be the default??
