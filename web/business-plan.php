<h3>Hungry Crayon - The General Business plan</h3>

<h4>Small Business Automation Services</h4>
<ul>
<li>Leverage open source and free software (<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software>FOSS</a>) to provide small businesses with tools and services to increase productivity.</li>

<li>Open Source Software provides a very powerful and free library of software that has been developed over many years and is used in industry by many large Tech multi-national firms to provide mission-critical services<br>
<p text-indent: 100px><i>"Open Source : Programmers can charge money for the open source software they create or to which they contribute. But because most open source licenses require them to release their source code when they sell software to others, many open source software programmers find that charging users money for software services and support (rather than for the software itself) is more lucrative. This way, their software remains free of charge and they make money helping others install, use, and troubleshoot it"</i></p>

<li>By leveraging Open Source and the access to the low level source code that provides, we beleive we can build better more integrated solutions than 'off-the-shelf' pproducts that only do 1 thing, 1 way and do not integrate easilly with other things</li>
 
<li>Unfortunately the technical expertise required to leverage these tools makes this resource innaccessible to orgs that need them most (small businesses/educators etc)</li>

<li>Similar to the people behind open source software (link to mission). We believe the technical resources needed to enable small businesses to benefit from this wonderful technical resource should be made available in a cost effective way</li>
  
<li>By focusing on the more common problems (small private educators etc), costs can be further mutualized by sharing solutions across businesses</li>
  
<li>To further reduce costs, specific technical tasks could be farmed out to developers willing to donate their time to a not-for-profit cause <a href=http://socialcoder.org>socialcoder.org</a></li>
  
<li>Other flexible funding options could be to agree a share of cost saves. so small businesses only pay when efficiences are achieved because the software has yielded real savings</li>

<li>We would be happy to engage with a small business that has no idea what products/solutions they need and they leave it to us to figure out if we think we can build solutions that have a positive ROI</li>

<li>Through onsite training and ongoing online support; increase level of small businesses administrators tech skills so they can help themselves going forward, further reducing costs</li>
</ul>

<h4>The Learning Disability Business Plan</h4>

<ul>
<li>For not-for-profit purposes, share my personal experience in applying the above to create an immerseive desktop environment / prosthetic that levels the playing field for people with cognitive disorders</li>
  
<li>As an fello sufferer and Software Engineer, I have always been very keen to explore (and fascinated by) the benefits that can be gained from software to overcome issues that are in many cases, mechanical in nature ( data retrieval, listening, communicating)</li>
  
<li>I have a passion to help people like myself and those less fortunate to overcome the barriers society presents in education and business to so they can in turn leverage their exceptional talents to solve the worlds big problems</li>
 
<li>As a by product we would be giving students acces to Technology and software development, which can provide them new ways to interface with the world (note that software development is inofitself a difficult thing to do if you have EF issues)</li>
  
<li>Leveraging my experiences and successes despite ADHD/OCD in industry, social anxiety, imposterism etc</li>
  
<li>Marginal gains to achieve a non-medicinal benefit (tipping balance by maximizing everything else</li>

<li>Making the business case for diversity at companies like GS. Levelling the playing field in business - minimizing issues with communication using technology so advanced creativity and problem solving skills can be maxmized (the best idea does not equal the fastest or most eloquently presented one)</li>
</ul>
