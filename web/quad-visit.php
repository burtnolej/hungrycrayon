<h3>Hungry Crayon - Quad Visit</h3>

<p >In the context of our business plan, here are a few ideas of the types of things HungryCrayon may be able to help the Quad with</p>

<h4>Small Business Automation</h4>

<ul><li><span>Digitization and automation of the schools class scheduling and homework assignments to improve school efficiency and reduce annual running costs by ?? $/yr</li>
<li> Solution could be in the form of an electronic version of the 'Binder', that has recently been unsuccessfully piloted</li>
<li>Goal would be to make the 'eBinder' available on school provided personal electronic devices so that 'remembering to bring it' would not be an issue</li>
<li> eBinder would use a central database and synchronize regularly throughout the day, making it easy to update scheduling information as needed</li>
<li>Through the use of smart input templates to enforce standards and a simple commenting tool, the eBinder would help to make teacher/student updates more consistent, readable and useful</li>
<li>This solution would provide a base platform on which specific eLearning tools can be added at a later stage and deployed to to all staff/ students</li>
<li>A 'workflow engine' would be used on top of the central database to track  assignments, send reminders, discuss comments/work with parents/pupils</li>
<li>The eBinder would provide an improvement over the "Google Drive" by making it easier and more intuitive for parents to access the data online</li>
<li>By digitizing the school process in this way, future expansion of the number of students could be made cheaper</li>
<li>The solution will be dependent on a suitable hardware solution. Proposal is to investigate the viability of cheap / refurbished Samsung tablets that are small enough to be carried at all times and are sufficiently locked down to prevent unwanted distractions through unfettered internet access etc</li></ul>  

<h4>Educational Accelerators and Productivity Enhancers for Learning Differences</h4>
  
<ul><li>Using the base platform underpining 1; integrate actual eLearning tools and techniques, concepts that can be used during lessons/at home</li>
<li>An integrated desktop environment specifically designed to assist with all aspects of exec functioning issues. More effective than other solutions because the one-stop-shop solution eliminates the context switching between tools/apps that specialise in one aspect only. Minimizes the impact of exec functioning issues that get in the way of learning and focuses the student on what they need to be doing right now</li>
<li>Tools to assist with the organization and storage of thoughts that will in turn speed up retrieval. Tagging with mnemonics, visual data connections, rapid thought storage techniques including fast-typing to get the thought down (in a retreivable way) before attention shifts</li>
<li>Visual ways to understand complexity</li>
<li>Promotion and reinforcement of self awareness / monitoring / introspection</li>
<li>Statistical analysis of when students are 'concentrating' and 'engaged' based on when they are using the apps</li>
<li>Combines management of diet, exercise, breaks, sleep and correlates with attention stats to maximize marginal gains</li>
<li>Platform integrates reward system. Student gains internet, game access (in the same environment) by achieving certain work / attention related targets</li>
<li>Enable students to try different tools and techniques to figure out what works for themselves</li>
<li>Use big data concepts to store as much data as possible about students to look for patterns, monitor progress</li>
<li>Gives students the ability to customize the environment either through configuration or through learning programming skills. So can become a technology training tool in its own right</li>
<li>Strong use of digital workflow constantly reminds students on what they have done ,what they should be doing now and what they are going to do. Allows them to delegate the problem of multi-tasking/context switching</li>
<li>Explores ways to allow students to work 'in their own time' and fully leverage the 14hrs they are awake to lesson the dependency on being 'on' during official school hours</li>
<li>Keeping track of a students cognitive resistance and recommending controlled breaks before attention goes so they can more easilly pick up where they left off</li></ul>


<h4>Possible Next Steps</h4> 

<ul>
<li>Analysis of actual school workflow and of what went wrong with the binder and the "google drive" - 1 week </li>

<li>Meet with Francisco - Quad staff member?? - Person most familiar with logistics of running the Quad and challenges in the past</li>
</ul>
  
<h4>Concerns</h4>

<ul>
<li>Plan for ongoing support must be in place - All tech solutions deteriorate and/or the problem evolves</li>

<li>Managing liabilities. We will keep costs low by using open source software but that means users accept any risks</li> 
</ul>
